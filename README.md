# Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, to predict student outcomes, 
such as dropout and academic success, based on various factors. The goal is to analyze and model student data to provide 
insights into the likelihood of student dropout and academic performance.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression Model**:
- The project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm for predictive modeling,
- which is well-suited for binary classification tasks like predicting student outcomes.

- **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**:
  - Handling Missing Data: Null values are identified and appropriately handled.
  - Duplicate Data: Duplicate records, if any, are addressed to ensure data integrity.
  - Statistical Summary: Basic statistical summary of the data is provided.
  - Data Visualization: Histograms are plotted to visualize the distribution of key features.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Correlation Analysis: Relationships between variables are explored to identify potential predictors.
  - Outlier Detection: Outliers are detected and treated as needed.
  - Label Encoding: Categorical variables are encoded to numerical values for machine learning.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Model Training: Logistic Regression models are trained on the preprocessed data.
  - Standardization: Features are standardized to improve model performance.
  - Confusion Matrix: Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix.
  - Accuracy Assessment: The model's accuracy in predicting student outcomes is reported.
